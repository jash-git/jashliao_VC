  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h3>Can I get a copy of this site?</h3>We do provide <a href=
  "cppreference-files.tar.gz" tppabs="http://www.cppreference.com/cppreference-files.tar.gz">a
  downloadable archived version of cppreference.com</a>. If you&#39;re
  interested in getting archived versions of websites in general, you
  might want to check out utilities like <a href=

  (Windows version <a href=

  <h3>Can I translate this site to some other language?</h3>Sure, that
  would be great!  All that we would ask is that you include a link
  back to this site so that people know where to get the most
  up-to-date content.

  <h3>Who is this site meant for?</h3>There are no &quot;Introduction
  to Programming&quot; tutorials here. This site is meant to be used by
  more-or-less experienced C++ programmers, who have a good idea of
  what they want to do and simply need to look up the syntax. If
  you&#39;re interested in learning C/C++, try one of these sites:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.howstuffworks.com/c.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.howstuffworks.com/c.htm'" tppabs="http://www.howstuffworks.com/c.htm">How C Programming
    Works</a></li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Does this site contain a complete and definitive list of C/C++
  functions?</h3>Few things in life are absolute. If you don&#39;t find
  what you are looking for here, don&#39;t assume that it doesn&#39;t
  exist. Do a search on <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.google.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.google.com/'" tppabs="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> for
  it.

  <h3>Some of the examples on this site don&#39;t work on my system.
  What&#39;s going on?</h3>Most of the code on this site was compiled

  "javascript:if(confirm('http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html'" tppabs="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">Compiler Collection</a>.
  Since this site is merely a reference for the <a href=
  "javascript:if(confirm('http://www.ncits.org/cplusplus.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.ncits.org/cplusplus.htm'" tppabs="http://www.ncits.org/cplusplus.htm"> Standard C and C++
  specification</a>, not every compiler will support every function
  listed here. For example,

  <ul>
    <!-- <LI>I've never had much luck getting 
                  <A HREF="cppbitset.html">C++ Bitsets</A>
                  to work on my computer - but they're listed here.  not needed now -->

    <li>Header files change like mad. To include the necessary support
    for <a href="index-14.html" tppabs="http://www.cppreference.com/cppvector/index.html">C++ Vectors</a>, you might have
    to use any of these:
      <pre class="example-code">
  #include &lt;vector&gt;
  #include &lt;Vector&gt;
  #include &lt;vector.h&gt;
</pre>(according to the spec, the first of those should work, and the
compiler should know enough to use it to reference the real vector
header file.)
    </li>

    <li>Another header file issue is that newer compilers can use a
    more platform-independent commands to include standard C libraries.
    For example, you might be able to use
      <pre class="example-code">
  #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
</pre>instead of
      <pre class="example-code">
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>All of the code on this site assumes that the correct namespace
    has been designated. If your compiler is a little old, then you
    might be able to get away with using simple statements like:
      <pre class="example-code">
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world!&quot;;
</pre>However, newer compilers require that you either use
      <pre class="example-code">
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world!&quot;;
</pre>or declare what namespace to use with the &quot;using
namespace&quot; command.
    </li>

    <li>Certain popular compilers (like the one shipped with
    Microsoft&#39;s Visual C++) have added alternative or additional
    functionality to the C++ Standard Template Library. For example,
    the MFC in Visual C++ provides you with the string type
    &quot;CString&quot;, which has string functionality but is not part
    of the C++ STL.</li>
  </ul>...The list goes on and on. In other words, individual results
  may vary.
