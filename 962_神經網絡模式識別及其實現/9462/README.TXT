The code on this diskette has been organized by chapter.  Each subdirectory
containing listing has a readme.txt describing program usage and any relevent
file formats.  The readme will also describe how to compile the target
programs under IBM OS/2 (TM) using the using C Set++ compiler (TM).  All programs on
this diskette have been compiled and tested in this environment.  The majority
of programs on this diskette should port to other environments with only minor
adjustments.  The exception to this are those programs which utilize 
presentation manager for graphical display of program data. In particular,
the grid1 programs in \chapt4\backprop\ and \chapt3\ fall into this latter category.
