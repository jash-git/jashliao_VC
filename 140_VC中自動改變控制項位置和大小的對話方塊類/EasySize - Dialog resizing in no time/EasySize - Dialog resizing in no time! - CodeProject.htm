<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Have you ever thought of how annoying it actually was to spend a lot of time
 doing a basic GUI for your simple applications instead of focusing on the actual 
 'content'? Take for example a resizing dialog or property page. You need to write code
  for each control that will tell it where to go when the thing is resized, and this can take up a lot of time. Now I know that I'm not the first one to give a solution to this
 (<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dialog/resizabledialog.asp">CResizableDialog</a>), but this article is on my approach.
  </p>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Basically, all you need to do is design your dialog the way you want it to 
look in the resource editor (don't forget to make it resizable), and then define how the
 controls will behave when the dialog is resized using one single macro for each control.</p>
 

<h2>Usage </h2>
<p>Note that all this works exactly the same way with both <code>CDialog</code> and 
<code>CPropertyPage</code></p>

<ol>
<li><code><span class="cpp-preprocessor">#include  </span></code><em>EasySize.h</em> to your <em>stdafx.h</em> 
(or put it in your include directory and
 <code><span class="cpp-preprocessor">#include  </span></code><em>&lt;EasySize.h&gt;</em> , which I recommend)
</li>
<li>Add <code>DECLARE_EASYSIZE</code> anywhere in your class declaration:
</li>
<div class="pre-action-link" id="premain0" width="100%" style="display:block"><img id="preimg0" src="./EasySize - Dialog resizing in no time! - CodeProject_files/minus.gif" height="9" width="9" preid="0" style="cursor: pointer;"><span id="precollapse0" preid="0" style="cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Collapse</span><span> | </span><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1657/EasySize-Dialog-resizing-in-no-time#" preid="0">Copy Code</a></div><pre id="pre0" style="margin-top: 0px;"><span class="code-keyword">class</span> CEasySizeDemoDlg : <span class="code-keyword">public</span> CDialog
{
DECLARE_EASYSIZE
...</pre>
<li>Create an <code>OnInitDialog</code> handler if it doesn't already exist, 
and put this in the end of it: "<code>INIT_EASYSIZE;</code>" :</li>
<div class="pre-action-link" id="premain1" width="100%" style="display:block"><img id="preimg1" src="./EasySize - Dialog resizing in no time! - CodeProject_files/minus.gif" height="9" width="9" preid="1" style="cursor: pointer;"><span id="precollapse1" preid="1" style="cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Collapse</span><span> | </span><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1657/EasySize-Dialog-resizing-in-no-time#" preid="1">Copy Code</a></div><pre lang="c++" id="pre1" style="margin-top: 0px;">BOOL CEasySizeDemoDlg::OnInitDialog()
{
    CDialog::OnInitDialog();
...    
    INIT_EASYSIZE;
    <span class="code-keyword">return</span> TRUE; <span class="code-comment">//</span><span class="code-comment"> return TRUE  unless you set the focus to a control
</span>} </pre>
<li>Create an <code>OnSize</code> handler and add the <code>UPDATE_EASYSIZE;</code> macro to it:</li>
<div class="pre-action-link" id="premain2" width="100%" style="display:block"><img id="preimg2" src="./EasySize - Dialog resizing in no time! - CodeProject_files/minus.gif" height="9" width="9" preid="2" style="cursor: pointer;"><span id="precollapse2" preid="2" style="cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Collapse</span><span> | </span><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1657/EasySize-Dialog-resizing-in-no-time#" preid="2">Copy Code</a></div><pre lang="c++" id="pre2" style="margin-top: 0px;"><span class="code-keyword">void</span> CEasySizeDemoDlg::OnSize(UINT nType, <span class="code-keyword">int</span> cx, <span class="code-keyword">int</span> cy) 
{
    CDialog::OnSize(nType, cx, cy);
    UPDATE_EASYSIZE;
} </pre>
<li>Optional - If you want your dialog to have a minimum size, 
then create an <code>OnSizing</code> handler and add the <code>EASYSIZE_MINSIZE</code> macro as below:</li>
<div class="pre-action-link" id="premain3" width="100%" style="display:block"><img id="preimg3" src="./EasySize - Dialog resizing in no time! - CodeProject_files/minus.gif" height="9" width="9" preid="3" style="cursor: pointer;"><span id="precollapse3" preid="3" style="cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Collapse</span><span> | </span><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1657/EasySize-Dialog-resizing-in-no-time#" preid="3">Copy Code</a></div><pre lang="c++" id="pre3" style="margin-top: 0px;"><span class="code-keyword">void</span> CEasySizeDemoDlg::OnSizing(UINT fwSide, LPRECT pRect) 
{
    CDialog::OnSizing(fwSide, pRect);
    EASYSIZE_MINSIZE(<span class="code-digit">280</span>,<span class="code-digit">250</span>,fwSide,pRect);
}
<span class="code-comment">//</span><span class="code-comment">(in this example, 280 is the minimum width and 250 the 
</span><span class="code-comment">//</span><span class="code-comment">minimum height we want our dialog to have)</span></pre>
<li>Now you have to create the "EasySize Map" (or whatever you want to call it) in which you will specify 
the behavior of each dialog item. It can be placed anywhere inside your class implementation. 
The map looks like this:</li>
<div class="pre-action-link" id="premain4" width="100%" style="display:block"><img id="preimg4" src="./EasySize - Dialog resizing in no time! - CodeProject_files/minus.gif" height="9" width="9" preid="4" style="cursor: pointer;"><span id="precollapse4" preid="4" style="cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Collapse</span><span> | </span><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1657/EasySize-Dialog-resizing-in-no-time#" preid="4">Copy Code</a></div><pre lang="c++" id="pre4" style="margin-top: 0px;">BEGIN_EASYSIZE_MAP(class_name)
    ...
    EASYSIZE(control,left,top,right,bottom,options)
    ...
END_EASYSIZE_MAP
</pre>
<p>The map from the demo application looks like this:</p>
<div class="pre-action-link" id="premain5" width="100%" style="display:block"><img id="preimg5" src="./EasySize - Dialog resizing in no time! - CodeProject_files/minus.gif" height="9" width="9" preid="5" style="cursor: pointer;"><span id="precollapse5" preid="5" style="cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Collapse</span><span> | </span><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1657/EasySize-Dialog-resizing-in-no-time#" preid="5">Copy Code</a></div><pre lang="c++" id="pre5" style="margin-top: 0px;">...

<p>Looks confusing? It's not once you get the point (and I know I'm not good at explaining it) Read on. </p>
</ol>
<h2>EASYSIZE Macro </h2>
<p>The <code>EASYSIZE</code> macro is used in the EasySize Map 
to specify what behavior your controls will have on dialog resize. 
It looks like this: </p>

<div class="pre-action-link" id="premain6" width="100%" style="display:block"><img id="preimg6" src="./EasySize - Dialog resizing in no time! - CodeProject_files/minus.gif" height="9" width="9" preid="6" style="cursor: pointer;"><span id="precollapse6" preid="6" style="cursor: pointer; margin-bottom: 0px;"> Collapse</span><span> | </span><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1657/EasySize-Dialog-resizing-in-no-time#" preid="6">Copy Code</a></div><pre lang="c++" id="pre6" style="margin-top: 0px;">EASYSIZE(control,left,top,right,bottom,options)</pre>

<p><code>control</code> is the ID of the dialog item you want 
re-positioned (which will be referred to as the 'current control' further on).</p>

<p><code>left, top, right and bottom</code> can be either the ID of 
another control in the dialog (not the current control), or one of the
 special values, <code>ES_BORDER</code> and <code>ES_KEEPSIZE</code>.</p>
 
<p>Basically, if you specify an ID, the distance from the current control and
 the item designated by the ID will remain the same when the dialog is 
 resized: The current control will 'stick' to the other item. <code>ES_BORDER</code> 
 works the same way as if you had specified a control ID, except that it's the distance
  between the current control and the dialog border that will be kept constant.
Specifying <code>ES_KEEPSIZE</code> in, let's say <code>left</code>, will keep 
the width of the current control the same, and will make the current control 
right-aligned to whatever you specified in <code>right</code>.
 The width (or height, if you specified <code>ES_KEEPSIZE</code> in
  <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code>) of the current control will
   always remain what it is in the dialog resource. (I know this explanation sucks, 
   but look at the demo application if you are confused or post you question in the board below). 
   Obviously <code>ES_KEEPSIZE</code> cannot be specified in both <code>"left</code> and <code>right"</code> or <code>
"top</code> and <code>bottom"</code>. </p>

<p><code>options</code> can be a combination of <code>ES_HCENTER</code>, 
<code>ES_VCENTER</code> and 0 (use 0
 if you don't want any of the other).
<code>ES_HCENTER</code> horizontally centers the control between 
the two items specified in <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> 
(both of those can not be <code>ES_KEEPSIZE</code>!). The width of the 
current control will always remain the same as in the dialog resource.
 <code>ES_VCENTER</code> works the same way, but for vertical centering 
 (using <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code>, and where the height will remain constant). </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well I hope you figured out how this works, because it really can make your life easier. 
Note that using these macros will probably make your compiled code slightly 
bigger and slower than if you had coded the resizing routines manually, but in 
most cases the change is so small not even you will notice. </p>
<p>Last Update - Just corrected a few typos.</p>

												<td colspan="2">Hi,<br>&nbsp;<br>We are facing an issue while using easy size api, which we want to share with you. We are using MFC for dialog based GUI in c++ and inserting multiple controls on the GUI. <br>&nbsp;<br>We have placed four controls, i.e. First one would be alligned Left Top, Second one will be in front of First but aligned Top Right, Third one will be below the first control an aligned left and fourth control would be placed below the Second control aligned right. Each of them are equally spaced with each other.<br>&nbsp;<br>The requirement is to re size the GUI at run time in such a way that all the controls are also re sized and spacing between them should remain consistent.<br>&nbsp;<br>We were trying to do so but the controls were overlapping in our case.<br>&nbsp;<br>We would request you guide us at code level, as to how we should handle such a scenario and how the parameters should be set that equal spacing and resizing of controls are maintained.<br>&nbsp;<br>We would appreciate your feedback / comments.<br>&nbsp;<br>Regards,<br>Ankita<br></td>

Here is the direct link to the comment: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dialog/easysize.aspx?msg=1198087#xx1198087xx">FormView Solution</a>[<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dialog/easysize.aspx?msg=1198087#xx1198087xx" target="_blank" title="New Window">^</a>]<br>

I followed his instructions (not the one about the window opened at max) and they seemed to work better than some of the other suggestions.  I'm not sure if this code is hosted anywhere or if a permanent fix can be found, but I'm still finding this it useful.<br></td>
